# SwimmingSchoolSystem
The Hatfield Junior Swimming School (HJSS) needs software for managing bookings made by the learners. The 
school offers swimming lessons at Grade 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Each lesson lasts for one hour and can accommodate 4 
learners at most. The school run lessons on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday each week. For Monday, 
Wednesday, and Friday, there are 3 time slots for the lessons (4-5pm, 5-6pm, 6-7pm) on each day. For Saturday, 
there are 2 time slots for the lessons (2-3pm, 3-4pm). The school has a number of coaches, and they can teach at 
all the grades. Each learner has a record stored on the system holding their name, gender, age, emergency contact 
phone number, and current grade level. A learner’s age needs to be between 4 and 11. The grade level can be 0 to 
5 (0 means new to swimming). 
A learner who wants to book a swimming lesson has three ways to view the timetable. The first way is to view by 
day. For example, a learner has chosen Saturday, then all the lessons on all Saturdays in the timetable will be 
displayed. The second way is to view by the grade level. For example, a learner has chosen Grade 1, then all the 
Grade 1 lessons on all the days in the timetable will be displayed. The third way is to view by the coach’s name. 
For example, a learner has chosen Helen (assuming Helen is a coach in HJSS), then all the lessons taught by Helen 
in the timetable will be displayed. The learner will then book a lesson according to the displayed timetable. The 
timetable needs to show if there are vacancies in each lesson. 
A learner can book a lesson having the same grade level as their current level or just one more level higher than 
their current level. For example, a Grade 1 learner can book Grade 1 lesson or Grade 2 lesson. After the learner 
has attended the lesson with one more level higher, their current grade level is updated. In the example, the Grade 
1 learner’s grade level will be updated to 2 after s/he attended the grade 2 lesson. Learners are allowed to change 
a booking, provided there are still spaces available for their newly selected lesson. Learners are also allowed to 
cancel a booking before the booked lesson was attended. A learner can book as many lessons as they want, but no 
duplicate booking is allowed. 
After each swimming lesson, a learner can write a review of the lesson they have attended and provide a numerical 
rating ranging from 1 to 5 (1: Very dissatisfied, 2: Dissatisfied, 3: Ok, 4: Satisfied, 5: Very Satisfied). The review 
and rating information will be recorded in the system. After four weeks, the software system must print: 
• a report containing the detailed information of each learner, i.e., the lessons s/he has booked, cancelled, and 
attended. You need to list these lessons and the number of each category (booked, cancelled, attended). 
• a report containing the information of each coach, i.e., their names, and their respective average ratings 
received.
